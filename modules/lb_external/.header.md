# Externally-Facing Regional TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer on GCP

- A regional LB, which is faster than a global one.
- IPv4 only, a limitation imposed by GCP.
- Perhaps unexpectedly, the External TCP/UDP NLB has additional limitations imposed by GCP when comparing to the Internal TCP/UDP NLB, namely:

  - Despite it works for any TCP traffic (also UDP and other protocols), it can only use a plain HTTP health check. So, HTTPS or SSH probes are *not* possible.
  - Can only use the nic0 (the base interface) of an instance.
  - Cannot serve as a next hop in a GCP custom routing table entry.

## Limitation

### Supported Module Version with Regards to the Changed Provider's Default Values

- Module versions `<=2.0.6` supports `terraform-provider-google` version `<6.0`. If you are using `terraform-provider-google` version `6.0` and above choose module version `2.0.7` and above. This limitation is related to the [change](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/commit/267f964bd4f2d9b48e8771c2a8397de3f6655ef7) in the default value of `balancing_mode` introduced in the `terraform-provider-google` version `6.0`
