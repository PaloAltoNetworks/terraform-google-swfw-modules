# Reference architecture with Terraform : GCP Cloud Next-Generation Firewall

Palo Alto Network provides a fully managed cloud-based Next-Generation Firewall in GCP , called the "Cloud NGFW". This example demonstrates the deployment of the Cloud NGFW in a GCP environment.

[Cloud NGFW Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/firewall?hl=en) is a fully distributed firewall service with advanced protection capabilities to protect your Google Cloud workloads from internal & external threats, including: intrusion, malware, spyware, and command-and-control. The service works by creating Google-managed zonal [firewall endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-firewall-endpoints) that use packet intercept technology to transparently intercept workload traffic for deep packet inspection.

## Reference Architecture Design

In this example, a VPC network contains two virtual machines, `client-vm` & `web-server-vm`. The `client-vm` simulates threats for both north/south internet traffic and east/west traffic to a web application on the `web-vm`.

To prevent the malicious traffic, a Cloud NGFW endpoint is created and associated to the network, where network firewall policies define how the traffic should be inspected by Cloud NGFW.

<INSERT PICTURE HERE>

With the default variable values - the topology consists of:
  - A VPC network with one subnet
  - A service account used by the Linux VMs
  - One client VM instance named "client-vm"
  - One web server VM instance named "web-server-vm"
  - A Cloud NGFW endpoint associated with the VPC network and zone
  - A cloud router and cloud NAT in order to facilitate internet access to the VMs
  - A network security profile and associated group
  - A network policy containing 2 rules - one `ingress` and one `egress` in order to redirect and inspect traffic

## Prerequisites

- Appropriate IAM access to be able to use Compute Engine and Cloud Firewall services in the selected GCP project.

For more information, please see:
* [IAM Roles - Firewall Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-firewall-endpoints#iam-roles)
* [IAM Roles - Firewall Endpoint Associations](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-firewall-endpoints#endpoint-association)
* [IAM Roles - Security Profiles](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-security-profiles#iam-roles)
* [IAM Roles - Global Network Firewall Policies](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/network-firewall-policies#iam) 

## Usage

1. Access Google Cloud Shell or any other environment that has access to your GCP project

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules
cd terraform-google-swfw-modules/examples/cloud_ngfw
```

3. Copy the `example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`.

`project`, `org_id` and `region` should be modified for successful deployment and access to the instance. 

There are also a few variables that have some default values but which should also be changed as per deployment requirements:

  - `name_prefix`

4. Apply the terraform code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

5. Check the successful application and outptus of the resulting infrastructure:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 21 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

## Post-deployment

After the deployment is complete - using the default network security profile - use the following environment variable to test out the security enforced policies:

```bash
export REMOTE_SCRIPT='
ns1=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://www.eicar.org/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh --data "echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; uname -a" --max-time 2)
ns2=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://www.eicar.org/cgi-bin/user.sh -H "FakeHeader:() { :; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/uname -a" --max-time 2)
ns3=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://www.eicar.org/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/etc/passwd --max-time 2)
ew1=$(curl -w "%{http_code}\\n" -s -o /dev/null http://10.0.0.20/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh --data "echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; uname -a" --max-time 2)
ew2=$(curl -w "%{http_code}\\n" -s -o /dev/null http://10.0.0.20/cgi-bin/user.sh -H "FakeHeader:() { :; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/uname -a" --max-time 2) 
ew3=$(curl -w "%{http_code}\\n" -s -o /dev/null http://10.0.0.20/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/etc/passwd --max-time 2)
echo ""
echo "Response Codes (north/south) :  $ns1 $ns2 $ns3"
echo "Response Codes (east/west)   :  $ew1 $ew2 $ew3"
echo ""'
```

Now run this script on the client-vm instance to verify the security policies in action:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh <name_prefix>client-vm --tunnel-through-iap --command="bash -c '$REMOTE_SCRIPT'"
```

After running the command - if the traffic is successfuly inspected and blocked by the Cloud NGFW, you should see the following response codes:

```bash
Response Codes (north/south) :  000 000 000
Response Codes (east/west)   :  000 000 000
```

Now you can also check the logs in Cloud Console Network Security -> Cloud NGFW -> Threats.
