# Common Option

The common firewall option leverages a single set of VM-Series firewalls. The sole set of firewalls operates as a shared resource and may present scale limitations with all traffic flowing through a single set of firewalls due to the performance degradation that occurs when traffic crosses virtual routers. This option is suitable for proof-of-concepts and smaller scale deployments because the number of firewalls is low. However, the technical integration complexity is high.

![VM-Series-Multi-NIC-Common-Firewall-Option](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules/assets/2110772/017aad21-46c8-4030-853a-f32096da754c)

The scope of this code is to deploy an example of the [VM-Series Common Firewall Option](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/apps/pan/public/downloadResource?pagePath=/content/pan/en_US/resources/guides/gcp-architecture-guide#Design%20Model) but with a slight modification in the architecture - the VM-Series is directly connected to the spoke VPCs. There are some advantages to this architecture from a routing perspective but there is also a limitation related to the [maximum number of NICs on the VM-Series](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-use-multiple-interfaces#max-interfaces) within GCP.

The example makes use of VM-Series full [bootstrap process](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-2/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall-on-google) using XML templates to properly parametrize the initial Day 0 configuration.

With default variable values the topology consists of :
 - 4 VPC networks :
   - Management VPC
   - Untrust (outside) VPC
   - Spoke-1 (Trust 1) VPC
   - Spoke-2 (Trust 2) VPC
 - 2 VM-Series firewalls
 - 2 Linux Ubuntu VMs (inside Spoke VPCs - for testing purposes)
 - two internal network loadbalancers (for outbound/east-west traffic) - one per spoke VPC
 - one external regional network loadbalancer (for inbound traffic)

## Prerequisites

The following steps should be followed before deploying the Terraform code presented here.

1. Prepare [VM-Series licenses](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)
2. Configure the terraform [google provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#authentication-configuration)

## Usage

1. Access Google Cloud Shell or any other environment that has access to your GCP project

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules
cd terraform-google-swfw-modules/examples/multi_nic_common
```

3. Copy the `example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`.

`project`, `ssh_keys` and `source_ranges` should be modified for successful deployment and access to the instance. 

There are also a few variables that have some default values but which should also be changed as per deployment requirements

 - `region`
 - `vmseries.<fw-name>.bootstrap_options`
 - `linux_vms.<vm-name>.linux_disk_size`

1. Apply the terraform code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply 
```

4. Check the output plan and confirm the apply.

5. Check the successful application and outputs of the resulting infrastructure:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 77 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. (Number of resources can vary based on how many instances you push through tfvars)

Outputs:

lbs_external_ips = {
  "external-lb" = {
    "all-ports" = "<EXTERNAL_LB_PUBLIC_IP>"
  }
}
lbs_internal_ips = {
  "internal-lb-spoke1" = "10.10.12.5"
  "internal-lb-spoke2" = "10.10.13.5"
}
linux_vm_ips = {
  "spoke1-vm" = "192.168.1.2"
  "spoke2-vm" = "192.168.2.2"
}
vmseries_private_ips = {
  "fw-vmseries-01" = {
    "0" = "10.10.11.2"
    "1" = "10.10.10.2"
    "2" = "10.10.12.2"
    "3" = "10.10.13.2"
  }
  "fw-vmseries-02" = {
    "0" = "10.10.11.3"
    "1" = "10.10.10.3"
    "2" = "10.10.12.3"
    "3" = "10.10.13.3"
  }
}
vmseries_public_ips = {
  "fw-vmseries-01" = {
    "0" = "<UNTRUST_PUBLIC_IP>"
    "1" = "<MGMT_PUBLIC_IP>"
  }
  "fw-vmseries-02" = {
    "0" = "<UNTRUST_PUBLIC_IP>"
    "1" = "<MGMT_PUBLIC_IP>"
  }
}

```


## Post build

Connect to the VM-Series instance(s) via SSH using your associated private key and check if the bootstrap process if finished successfuly and then set a password :
  - Please allow for up to 10-15 minutes for the bootstrap process to finish
  - The key output you should check for is "Auto-commit Successful"

```
ssh admin@x.x.x.x -i /PATH/TO/YOUR/KEY/id_rsa
Welcome admin.
admin@PA-VM> show system bootstrap status

```

## Check access via web UI

Use a web browser to access `https://<MGMT_PUBLIC_IP>` and login with admin and your previously configured password.

## Change the public Loopback public IP Address

For the VM-Series that are backend instance group members of the public-facing loadbalancer - go to Network -> Interfaces -> Loopback and change the value of `1.1.1.1` with the value from the `EXTERNAL_LB_PUBLIC_IP` from the terraform outputs.

## Check traffic from spoke VMs

The firewalls are bootstrapped with a generic `allow any` policy just for demo purposes along with an outboud SNAT policy to allow Inernet access from spoke VMs.

SSH to one of the spoke VMs using GCP IAP and gcloud command and test connectivity :


```
gcloud compute ssh spoke1-vm
No zone specified. Using zone [us-east1-b] for instance: [spoke1-vm].
External IP address was not found; defaulting to using IAP tunneling.
WARNING: 

To increase the performance of the tunnel, consider installing NumPy. For instructions,
please see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#increasing_the_tcp_upload_bandwidth

<USERNAME>@spoke1-vm:~$ping 8.8.8.8
<USERNAME>@spoke1-vm:~$ping 192.168.2.2
