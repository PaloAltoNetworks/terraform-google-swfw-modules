# Palo Alto Networks VM-Series NGFW Module Example

A Terraform module example for deploying a VM-Series NGFW in GCP using the [metadata](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-2/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/choose-a-bootstrap-method#idf6412176-e973-488e-9d7a-c568fe1e33a9) bootstrap method.

This example can be used to familarize oneself with both the VM-Series NGFW and Terraform - it creates a single instance of virtualized firewall in a Security VPC with a management-only interface and lacks any traffic inspection.
