# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in GCP, Centralized Architecture, Common NGFW Option - IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack

Palo Alto Networks produces several [validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures), which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.
The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in GCP based on a centralized design with common VM-Series for all traffic; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from [the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules/assets/2110772/9530fc51-7267-4b74-a996-a522b97f0996)

This code implements:
- a _centralized design_, a hub-and-spoke topology with a shared VPC containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the _common option_, which routes all traffic flows onto a single set of VM-Series

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a VPC Peering. Application functions are distributed across multiple projects that are connected in a logical hub-and-spoke topology. A security project acts as the hub, providing centralized connectivity and control for multiple application projects. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the security project. The spoke projects contain the workloads and necessary services to support the application deployment.
This design model integrates multiple methods to interconnect and control your application project VPC networks with resources in the security project. VPC Peering enables the private VPC network in the security project to peer with each application project VPC network. Using Shared VPC, the security project administrators create and share VPC network resources from within the security project to the application projects. The application project administrators can select the network resources and deploy the application workloads.

### Common Option

The common firewall option leverages a single set of VM-Series firewalls. The sole set of firewalls operates as a shared resource and may present scale limitations with all traffic flowing through a single set of firewalls due to the performance degradation that occurs when traffic crosses virtual routers. This option is suitable for proof-of-concepts and smaller scale deployments because the number of firewalls is low. However, the technical integration complexity is high.

![VM-Series-Common-Firewall-Option-Dual-Stack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/427a318e-5288-456f-ab3f-72a7cad73ba2)

The scope of this code is to deploy an example of the [VM-Series Common Firewall Option](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/apps/pan/public/downloadResource?pagePath=/content/pan/en_US/resources/guides/gcp-architecture-guide#Design%20Model) architecture within a GCP project.

The example makes use of VM-Series full [bootstrap process](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-2/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall-on-google) using XML templates to properly parametrize the initial Day 0 configuration.

With default variable values the topology consists of :
 - 5 VPC networks :
   - Management VPC
   - Untrust (outside) VPC
   - Trust (inside/security) VPC
   - Spoke-1 VPC
   - Spoke-2 VPC
 - 2 VM-Series firewalls
 - 2 Linux Ubuntu VMs (inside Spoke VPCs - for testing purposes)
 - one internal network loadbalancer (for outbound/east-west traffic)
 - one external regional network loadbalancer (for inbound traffic)

## IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack

This example implements end-to-end IPv6 connectivity (alongside with IPv4 connectivity, in dual stack fashion) for data VPCs:
 - Untrust (outside) VPC
 - Trust (inside/security) VPC
 - Spoke-1 VPC
 - Spoke-2 VPC

Untrust VPC is assigned with IPv6 adresses from an external IPv6 address range, while other VPCs (Trust, Spoke-1, Spoke-2) are utilizing private IPv6 ULA address range.

Management VPC connectivity is IPv4 only.

>**Note**: VM-Series must run PAN-OS version `>=11` to provide IPv6 support.

### IPv6 Routing

As of September 2024 there is a cloud provider [limitation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/static-routes#static-route-next-hops) that a static IPv6 route can't have a passthrough Network Load Balancer as the next hop.

To enable outbound routing from Spoke-1 and Spoke-2 VPCs a policy based route is used to forward traffic to the Internal Load Balancer and then VM-Series.

As of September 2024 `terraform-provider-google` supports `google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route` resources only for IPv4 protocol version. To overcome this limitation a `local-exec` provisioner running `gcloud beta network-connectivity policy-based-routes create <...>` is used to manage policy based routes.  

>**Note**: `local-exec` requires `gcloud` beta components. To install the components run `gcloud components install beta`.

## Prerequisites

The following steps should be followed before deploying the Terraform code presented here.

1. Prepare [VM-Series licenses](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)
2. Configure the Terraform [google provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#authentication-configuration)
3. Install `gcloud` beta components: `gcloud components install beta`

## Usage

1. Access Google Cloud Shell or any other environment that has access to your GCP project

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules
cd terraform-google-swfw-modules/examples/vpc_peering_common_dual_stack
```

3. Copy the `example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`.

`project`, `ssh_keys` and `source_ranges` should be modified for successful deployment and access to the instance.

There are also a few variables that have some default values but which should also be changed as per deployment requirements

 - `region`
 - `vmseries.<fw-name>.bootstrap_options`
 - `linux_vms.<vm-name>.linux_disk_size`

1. Apply the terraform code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

4. Check the output plan and confirm the apply.

5. Check the successful application and outputs of the resulting infrastructure:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 92 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. (Number of resources can vary based on how many instances you push through tfvars)

Outputs:

```

## Check access via web UI

Use a web browser to access `https://<MGMT_PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS>` and login with admin and your previously configured password.

## Configuration adjustment

Adjust VM-Series configuration according to the instructions below.

### Change the Loopback IP Addresses

For the VM-Series that are backend instance group members of the public-facing loadbalancer - go to Network -> Interfaces -> Loopback:
- IPv4 tab: change the value of `1.1.1.1` with the value from the `<EXTERNAL_LB_PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS>` from the Terraform outputs.
- IPv6 tab:
  - change the value of `1::1/128` with the value from the `<EXTERNAL_LB_PUBLIC_IPV6_ADDRESS>` from the Terraform outputs. Use `/128` as netmask.
  - change the value of `fd20::1/128` with the value from the `<INTERNAL_LB_PRIVATE_IPV6_ADDRESS>` from the Terraform outputs. Use `/128` as netmask.

### Change Source NAT IP pool

Navigate to Policies -> NAT -> [Internet-Access-NAT-IPv6] and cahnge Translated Packet -> Source Address Translation -> Translated Address from `1::/96` to `<UNTRUST_PUBLIC_IPV6_ADDRESS_WITH_NETMASK>`

## Check traffic from spoke VMs

The firewalls are bootstrapped with a generic `allow any` policy just for demo purposes along with an outboud SNAT policy to allow Inernet access from spoke VMs.

SSH to one of the spoke VMs using GCP IAP and gcloud command and test connectivity :

```
gcloud compute ssh spoke1-vm
No zone specified. Using zone [us-east1-b] for instance: [spoke1-vm].
External IP address was not found; defaulting to using IAP tunneling.
WARNING:

To increase the performance of the tunnel, consider installing NumPy. For instructions,
please see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#increasing_the_tcp_upload_bandwidth

<USERNAME>@spoke1-vm:~$ping ipv4.google.com
<USERNAME>@spoke1-vm:~$ping6 ipv6.google.com
```
