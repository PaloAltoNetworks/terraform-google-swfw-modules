# Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Common Firewall Option with network tags

The scope of this code is to deploy an example of the [VM-Series Common Firewall Option](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/apps/pan/public/downloadResource?pagePath=/content/pan/en_US/resources/guides/gcp-architecture-guide#Design%20Model) architecture in two regions and using network tags feature for traffic distribution within a GCP project.

The example makes use of VM-Series full [bootstrap process](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-2/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall-on-google) using XML templates to properly parametrise the initial Day 0 configuration.

## Topology

With default variable values the topology consists of :
 - 4 VPC networks :
   - Management VPC
   - Untrust (outside) VPC
   - Trust (inside/security) VPC
   - Spoke-1 VPC
 - 4 VM-Series firewalls (2 per region)
 - 2 Linux Ubuntu VMs (inside Spoke VPC - for testing purposes)
 - two internal network loadbalancer (for outbound/east-west traffic)
 - two external regional network loadbalancer (for inbound traffic)
 - two static routes with intance tag based on each region

![vpc-peering-network-tags](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules/assets/2110772/c2ba14e7-9895-48f1-b00d-766f11e0e5e8)

### Traffic flows details

- Each Spoke VM will have the network tag value of the `each.value.region` iterated variable thus inheriting the default route towards local region internal loadbalancer .
- In the bootstrap XML file there are two NAT policies configured :
  - One for outside traffic (trust to untrust).
  - One for east-west traffic (trust to trust) - this one is required for symmetric traffic flows for east-west traffic in case there are multiple spoke VPC networks.

## Prerequisites

1. Prepare [VM-Series licenses](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)

2. Configure the terraform [google provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#authentication-configuration)

## Build

1. Access Google Cloud Shell or any other environment which has access to your GCP project

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-google-swfw-modules
cd terraform-google-swfw-modules/examples/vpc-peering-common-with-network-tags
```

3. Fill out any modifications to `example.tfvars` file - at least `project`, `ssh_keys` and `source_ranges` should be modified for successful deployment and access to the instance. There is also a few variables that have some default values but which should also be changed as per deployment requirements :
 - vmseries
   - bootstrap_options
     - panorama-server
     - dns-primary
     - dns-secondary
  - linux_vms
    - linux_disk_size

4. Apply the terraform code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=example.tfvars
```

4. Check the output plan and confirm the apply.

5. Check the successful application and outputs of the resulting infrastructure:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 115 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. (Number of resources can vary based on how many instances you push through tfvars)

Outputs:

  }

  }
}

## Post build

Connect to the VM-Series instance(s) via SSH using your associated private key and check if the bootstrap process if finished successfuly and then set a password :
  - Please allow for up to 10-15 minutes for the bootstrap process to finish
  - The key output you should check for is "Auto-commit Successful"

```
ssh admin@x.x.x.x -i /PATH/TO/YOUR/KEY/id_rsa
Welcome admin.

## Check access via web UI

Use a web browser to access `https://<MGMT_PUBLIC_IP>` and login with admin and your previously configured password.

## Change the public Loopback public IP Address

For the VM-Series that are backend instance group members of the public-facing loadbalancer - go to Network -> Interfaces -> Loopback and change the value of `1.1.1.1` with the value from the `EXTERNAL_LB_PUBLIC_IP` from the terraform outputs.

## Check traffic from spoke VMs

The firewalls are bootstrapped with a generic `allow any` policy just for demo purposes along with an outboud SNAT policy to allow Inernet access from spoke VMs.

SSH to the spoke VMs using GCP IAP and gcloud command and test connectivity :


```
gcloud compute ssh spoke1-vm-<REGION_1_NAME>
No zone specified. Using zone [us-east1-b] for instance: [spoke1-vm].
External IP address was not found; defaulting to using IAP tunneling.
WARNING: 

To increase the performance of the tunnel, consider installing NumPy. For instructions,
please see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#increasing_the_tcp_upload_bandwidth

<USERNAME>@spoke1-vm:~$ping 8.8.8.8
```

```
gcloud compute ssh spoke2-vm-<REGION_2_NAME>
No zone specified. Using zone [us-west1-b] for instance: [spoke2-vm].
External IP address was not found; defaulting to using IAP tunneling.
WARNING: 

To increase the performance of the tunnel, consider installing NumPy. For instructions,
please see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#increasing_the_tcp_upload_bandwidth

<USERNAME>@spoke2-vm:~$ping 8.8.8.8
